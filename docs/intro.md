# Introduction to Land Explorer

Land Explorer is a web app with 3 repositories.

A static monopage site
A React app
A typescript server

## Static Site

The static site was generated by something, we don't know what by and we don't want to know. The output was downloaded from its host and then edited directly to make it work.
We're hoping to leave it behind at some point in the future. For now the job is to make small changes as and when is needed. Any requests for big changes should be rejected in favour of starting from scratch.

### Things to know

* There is a function in a `<script></script>` at the bottom of index.html that adjusts the app link based on where the static site is being looked at from. So if you change the domain of the app, or the staging domain, or add another testing domain, for the link to work this needs to be adjusted.

## React App

The react app was generated by create-react-app, several years ago. We're in the process of rewriting it from class-based to functional components. It heavily relies on a react-mapboxgl library for the mapping features.

### Things to know

* Ignore anything with Council in front of it, this is from a discontinued project with RBKC council
* There are Nav components and Map components, they communicate using redux.
* We get tilesets from Mapbox Studio
* Our base tileset uses ordnance survey data

## Hapi.js Back-end

We use a framework called Hapi.js in the back-end. We use typescript. 

We have 2 databases. 1 for LX users and LX generated data like markers, polygons etc. 1 for property boundaries from the Land Registry.
